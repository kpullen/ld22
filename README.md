# Sokobot
## A sokoban game I made for Ludum Dare 22

## The game
Yes, you are a robot. Yes, you slept through the end of the world. Yes, your power monitoring systems are about to go offline forever. Can you build a companion robot to fix you? Probably, the game is not that hard. But it's all I could do in about 10 hours or so of development time over the past 2 days.

## Assets
All are mine, EXCEPT for the font, which I got from Dafont. The license indicates that the font is free for personal use, so there should be no problem. Still, let me know if you are the author of the font and don't want me to use it. I will probably cry, but will remove it. It really is a beautiful font.
